My approach to this project...
What are Yelp Fusion APIs and what do I
need to use them
Figure out how to set up a server
	Node.js
	tutorial on how to
	Figure out server/client interactions
Oh I need location to do business search
	Figure out HTML5 Geolocation
	Use data in form, submit form to server
	How do I get the form data and send it to Yelp?
	Oh it returns a JSON thingy.
		How do I give this to the user and make it presentable?
		Jade!
	Since I have a presentable list of things,
	can I put them on a map with Google APIs?
		Yes!
		Markers? Numbers? Yes!
How do I give the user a better experience in using
my website?
	better UI/interactions
		Bootstrap
		Angular/React
	better welcome structure
		ASK QUESTIONS TO THE USER!
		SEARCH BASED ON WHAT THEY ANSWER!
